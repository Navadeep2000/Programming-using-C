# Programming-using-C

## This repository contains a collection of C programming practice problems that I have solved from various sources. These programs cover a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and system programming.

### Contents
The repository is organized into subdirectories based on the source of the practice problems. Each subdirectory contains the programs that I have solved from that particular source.

### Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to submit a pull request with your own solutions to the practice problems. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and follows the same coding style as the existing programs.
